## Introduction

In the realm of Computer Vision and Image Processing, This pattern recognition project was undertaken as part of the Visual Computing course in the academic year 2020/2021. The project's primary objective is to delve into the visual exploration of images containing still objects. By implementing image analysis techniques, the project endeavors to extract valuable visual information from the images.

## Project Overview

The project's focal point lies in the development of an image pattern recognition tool capable of exploring and interpreting the contents of images containing pennies among other still objects. Through a combination of image processing and analysis, the tool aims to provide insights into various attributes of the objects present in the images. The exploration process involves answering questions related to money and object count, centroid visualization, perimeter assessment, area calculation, and more.

### Technology Stack

The project utilizes the following stack:

- Matlab and Python for implementing image analysis techniques.

6. Ordering objects by area or perimeter.
7. Applying geometric transformations to objects and visualizing results.
8. Interactive visualization of object information on user selection.
9. Generating heatmaps based on object selection.
10. Generalizing heatmap generation for multiple selected objects.
11. Determining the quantity of money presented in the image.
12. Discussing the detection of coin heads or tails.
13. Allowing the user to work with new test images for evaluation.
